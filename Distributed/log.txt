    STRIPING AT LEARNER

eco_cartpole_custom_3xtra_v1-COPY1
    2 nodes X 500 episodes

eco_cartpole_custom_3xtra_v1
    10 nodes X 100 episodes
    WIDER ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM/MINIMUM values for XTRA features
    Added three extra features: masscart, masspole, length
    D3QN
    Striped Q-tables
    Two layers of granularity: 20 and 10
    STATE_SIZE = 20^4 * 10^3 = 160,000,000
    Quantization perfromed by Learner
